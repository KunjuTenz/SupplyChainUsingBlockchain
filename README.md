The provided Python code is an implementation of a blockchain-based supply chain management system with features for registering clients, distributors, and a manufacturer, creating and tracking transactions, mining new blocks, and handling delivery issues. Here's a brief description of what this code does:

1. **Blockchain Initialization:**
   - It defines a `Blockchain` class that initializes an empty blockchain, current and pending transactions, and dictionaries to store clients, distributors, and delivery status.
   - It also initializes a flag `mine_flag` to control the mining process.

2. **Registration:**
   - The `register_manufacturer`, `register_distributor`, and `register_client` methods allow registering the manufacturer, distributors, and clients with their respective security deposits.

3. **Transaction Creation:**
   - The `new_transaction` method creates a new transaction with sender, recipient, product, and price details and adds it to the list of pending transactions.

4. **Mining:**
   - The `mine_pending_transactions` method simulates mining by adding a new block to the blockchain.
   - It calculates the Merkle root of pending transactions, simulates Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET)-style random wait time, and creates a new block with the mined data.
   - Successful transactions are moved from pending to current transactions, and security deposits are updated.
   - QR codes are generated for each mined block.

5. **Transaction Confirmation:**
   - The `distributor_confirm_dispatch` method simulates distributor confirmation of product dispatch.
   - The `consumer_confirm_reception` method simulates consumer confirmation of product reception.

6. **Delivery Issue Resolution:**
   - The `resolve_delivery_issues` method identifies and resolves delivery issues based on the specified scenarios.
   - It checks for cases where a distributor dispatched a product, a client received it, but the client denies it or where neither the distributor dispatched nor the client received the product.
   - Security deposits are deducted from the lying party, either the distributor or the client, based on the scenario.

7. **Simulation Loop:**
   - The code runs in an infinite loop, simulating transactions between the manufacturer and distributors, as well as between distributors and clients.
   - It periodically mines new blocks and simulates transaction confirmations.
   - Delivery issues are resolved, and security deposits are updated.

8. **Keyboard Interrupt Handling:**
   - The code can be terminated gracefully with a keyboard interrupt (e.g., Ctrl+C).

This code provides a basic simulation of a supply chain management system using a blockchain with PoET-based mining and security deposit handling. It's important to note that this is a simplified simulation and would need further development, testing, and real-world integration to be used in a production environment.
